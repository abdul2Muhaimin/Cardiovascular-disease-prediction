# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction
Heart disease, once rare, is now a major global health concern. This study aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy with minimal error by comparing models like MLP, Random Forest, RNN, and LSTM. We evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time.
