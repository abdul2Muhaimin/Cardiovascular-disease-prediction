# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction
Heart disease, once rare, is now a major global health concern. This study aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy with minimal error by comparing models like MLP, Random Forest, RNN, and LSTM. We evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time.


Problem Statement:
Heart disease was an uncommon cause of death. Due to increasing complex Cardiac problems across the world, Valvular heart disease (cardiovascular disease) is one of the major threats to human life. The reason of 85% of deaths are caused by heart attack and stroke.

Motivation:
According to World Health Organization (WHO) research, an estimated 17.9 million human casualties are due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). This rapid growth of CVD compels us to develop an automatic detection of disease from the heartbeat and an effective treatment procedure and precautions required.

Objective:
The objective of this study is to evaluate and achieve the best accuracy with the lowest error rate in diagnosing disease. For doing this, we compute efficiency and effectiveness of those approaches in term of many Deep learning parameters, like MLP, Random forest, RNN, LSTM, that classified instances and time to build model, along with other parameters. One major challenge is to extract features from the heartbeat recordings having various noise sources. Different time-frequency and statistical features have been used in automatic heartbeat sound classification.
